# Akshay's readability fix of Team Seoul's assignment 3

- I changed the header font to "Bevan" because it matched the football theme. Then I uses PontanoSans for the rest of the text because according to Google Fonts, they pair well together.
- I changed the line-height to 1.5em in order to increase readability.
- I made the line-width shorter from 90% to 80% so the reader can span it more easily.
- I removed the figcaptions because they did not add much but cluttered the view
- I made the background color lighter to make more contrast between the text and background.
